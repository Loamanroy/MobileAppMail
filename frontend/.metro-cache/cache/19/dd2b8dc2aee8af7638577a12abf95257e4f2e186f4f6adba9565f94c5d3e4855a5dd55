It will be\n   * wrapped as a transformer to initialize the transducer. A transformer can be\n   * passed directly in place of an iterator function.

The step function is used as the iterator\n   * function in reduce. The result function is used to convert the final\n   * accumulator into the return type and in most cases is\n   * [`R.identity`](#identity). The init function can be used to provide an\n   * initial accumulator, but is ignored by transduce.\n   *\n   * The iteration is performed with [`R.reduce`](#reduce) after initializing the transducer.\n   *\n   * @func\n   * @memberOf R\n   * @since v0.12.0\n   * @category List\n   * @sig (c -> c) -> ((a, b) -> a) -> a -> [b] -> a\n   * @param {Function} xf The transducer function.
